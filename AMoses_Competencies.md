### 5. CODING STANDARDS

##### Code Formatting

- [x] While going through code, check the code formatting to improve readability and ensure there are no blockers

##### Architecture

- [x] Separation of Concerns followed


- [x] Split into respective files (HTML, JavaScript and CSS)


- [x] Split into multiple layers and tiers as per requirements (Presentation, Business, and Data Layers)


- [x] Code is in sync with existing code patterns/technologies


- [x] Design patterns: Use appropriate design pattern (if if helps), after completely understanding the problem and context

##### Coding Best Practices
*Demonstrated proficiency here: https://github.com/TechtonicGroup/HomeVestors_Kentico/blob/devbranches/Dev_Branch_Sprint71/BusinessEntities/Enums/StoredProcedures.cs*
- [x] No hard coding, use constants/configuration values


- [x] Group similar values under an enumeration (enum)


- [x] Comments - Do not write comments for what you are doing, instead write comments on why you are doing. Specify about any hacks workaround and temporary fixes. Additionally mention pending tasks in your to-do comments, which can be tracked easily


- [x] Avoid multiple if/else blocks


- [x] Use framework features, wherever possible instead of writing custom code

##### Non Functional Requirements

- [x] a.) Maintainability (Supportability) - The application should require the least amount of effort to support in the near future. It should be easy to identify, fix, and detect.

      ​	Readability: Code should be self-explanatory. Get a feel of story reading. whlile going through code. Use appropriate name for variables, functions and classes. If you are taking more time to understand  the code, then either code needs refactoring or at least comments have to be written to make it clear.

      ​	Testability: The code should be easy to test. Refactor into separate function (if required). Use interfaces while talking to other layers, as interfaces can be mocked easily. Try to avoid static functions, singleton classes as these are not easily testable by mocks.

      ​	Debuggability: Provide support to log the flow of control, paramater data and exception details to find the root cause easily. if you are using Log4Net like component then add support for database logging also as querying the log table is easy.

      ​	Configurability: Keep the configurable values in place (XML file, database table) so that no code changes are required, if the data is changed frequently.


- [x] b.) Reusability

      ​	DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) principle: The same code should not be repeated more than twice

      ​	Consider reusable services, functions and components

      ​	Consider generic functions and classes


- [x] c.) Reliability - Exception handling and cleanup (dispose) resources.



- [x] d.) Extensibility - Easy to add enhancements with minimal changes to existing code. One component should be easily replaceable by a better component.



- [x] e.) Security - Authentication, authorization, input data validation against security threats such as SQL injections and Cross Site Scripting (XSS), encrypting the sensitive data (passwords, credit card information etc.)



- [x] f.) Performance 

      Use a data type that best suits the needs such as StringBuilder, generic collection classes

      Lazy loading asynchronous and parallel processing

      Caching and session/application data

- [x] g.) Scalability - Consider if it supports a large user base/data? Can this be deployed into web farms?



- [x] h.) Usability - Put yourself in the shoes of a end-user and ascertain, if the user interface/API is easy to understand and use. If you are not convinced with the user interface design, then start discussing your ideas with the business analyst


##### Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) Principles

- [x] Single Responsibility Principle (SRS): Each class should only have one responsibility. Split multiple responsiblities into mutliple classes.


- [x] Open Closed Principle: New functionality should be added with minimal changes to existing code. Write original code so functionality can be added easily in the future. 


- [x] Liskov substitutability principle:  Any modification to a class should be written as a new class derived off of the old (base) class. That new class should not affect the behavior of the base (parent) class.


- [x] Interface segregation: Segregate interfaces into smaller interfaces. This allows the client to use only the interfaces it needs as opposed to forcing it to depend on parts of a lengthy interface it doesn't need.
    

- [x] Dependency Injection: Do not hardcode the dependencies, instead inject them. ex, use functionality pieces such as plugins as opposed to hard coding that functionality into a solution.
